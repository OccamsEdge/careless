\title{Calculates the intra-individual response variability (IRV)}
\usage{
irv(x, split = FALSE, numSplit = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix of data (e.g. survey responses)}

\item{split}{boolean indicating whether to additionally calculate the IRV on subsets of columns (of equal length).}

\item{numSplit}{the number of subsets the data is to be split in.}
}
\description{
A recently proposed index, somewhat similar to the LongString index, the IRV is the
"standard deviation of responses across a set of consecutive item responses for an individual"
(Dunn, Heggestad, Shanock, & Theilgard, 2018, p. 108).
By default, the IRV is calculated across all columns of the input data. Additionally it can be applied to different subsets of the data.
This can detect degraded response quality which occurs only in a certain section of the questionnaire (usually the end).
}
\examples{
# calculate the irv over all items
irvTotal <- irv(carelessDataset)

#calculate the irv over all items + calculate the irv for each quarter of the questionnaire
irvSplit <- irv(carelessDataset, split = TRUE, numSplit = 4)
boxplot(irvSplit$irv4) #produce a boxplot of the IRV for the fourth quarter
}
